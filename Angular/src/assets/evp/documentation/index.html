		<h3 id="important"><strong>A) Important notes make sure you read this!</strong> - <a href="#toc">top</a></h3>
		<p>Please note that the Easy Video Player installation and configuration is not complicated but because it has a lot of customizable settings it might seem complicated, please go through the entire documentation before trying to install it into your own page. Basically what it must be done is to copy some html code from the examples we provided and paste it into your own html page and of course add your own video file.</p>
		<p>Easy Video Player only requires the mp4 video format and it  will work in all browsers on a desktop machine or on a mobile device, this is extremely important because there is no need to create multiple video formats for browsers that dose not support mp4, also please note that the mp4 video format is recommended and used by all major browsers distributors like Google, Microsoft, Apple, Mozzila etc.!</p>
		<p>The server is character case sensitive so make sure that the Easy Video Player settings are identical to those from the provided examples.</p>
		<p style="color:#FF0000;">When using mp4 video files located on your server with relative paths you must add all folders that contains mp4's videos in the content folder, this is extremely important in order for all features to work correctly.</p>
		<p>It is important to understand that the more video instances are used the browser will be more stressed and problems may occur specially on mobile. If you think at all popular video websites like youtube or video they are only using a single video instance and this is done because of performance issues... Try to keep the Easy Video Player instances to a maximum of six instances if possible even less, this will help the browser to perform great. This recommendation applies to all video players available on the web including youtube or vimeo!</p>
		<p>When testing local on IE7/IE8 or on an older browser that dose not support HTML5 video it will not work because the flash (.swf) file is trying to communicate with the browser and this is not allowed, of course it will work fine when tested online.</p>
		<p>Some of the  features will not work local like the share button or playing youtube videos on some browsers like IE and Opera, or like playng vimeo videos, this is normal behavior because most browser does not allow this, once uploaded on the server it will function properly.</p>
		<p>If you don't need to use youtube set <span class="boldLi">useYoutube:"no"</span> the same applies if you don't want to use Vimeo set <span class="boldLi">useVimeo:"no"</span>, this is important because it will not createa the Vimeo or Youtube instances this will improve overall performance.</p>
		<p>When something is wrong with a Easy Video Player actions a info box with the problem description will appear over the Easy Video Player, please note that this box is there to help you understand the problem, for example if a mp4 video file is not found the box will appear and inform you about the problem. The box can be closed when clicked or touched.</p>
		<p>The Easy Video Player skin is constructed from .png images, only  a few settings for changing colors are possible like changing the time color. If you want a different skin the .png files must be modified. The skin is really flexible this is allowing to skin the Easy Video Player as you like. We have a great designer in our team so if you need a custom skin please contact us!</p>
		<p>To use EVP as a video a video background for your website set displayType:"backgroundVideo" .</p>
		<h3 id="instalation"><strong>B) Install Easy Video Player into your html page.</strong> - <a href="#toc">top</a></h3>
		<p>EVP has multiple display types (fluid width, responsive, fixed, fullscreen, after parent), each display type is explained in detail below.</p>

		<h4><strong>Responsive installation</strong></h3>

		<p>In the download files there is a start folder and in this folder there are html files starting with the label "responsive", each of this examples have exactly the same structure with different constructor settings. You can use one of them to copy and paste the required html code based on skin that you need, I will use the <span class="boldLi">responsive-skin-minimal-dark.html</span> as an example for this tutorial.</p>
		<p>The skin is created using javascript and .png images, if you want a custom skin please contact us. If you want to create a skin of your own modify the ones we already provided.</p>
		
		<ul>
			<li>Copy and paste the content folder and the java folder into the same folder with your .html file, inside the content folder there are other folders which are self explanatory. Keep only the skin folders that you need to save space on the server.</li>
			<li>Open responsive-skin-minimal-dark.html with a text editor.</li>
			<li>The javascript file must be imported, in the head section of your html file add the code from the below image.</li>
			<pre class="brush: js; html-script: true, class-name: 'negativeLeftMarginsHTML'">
				<script type="text/javascript" src="java/FWDEVPlayer.js"></script></pre>
			<li>You need a div into which the Easy Video Player will be added as a child, so create a div and set an id for it, the id is important because it is passed in the Easy Video Player constructor, make sure it is unique. The Easy Video Player is responsive as follows, the width will adapt based on the <span class="boldLi">maxWidth</span> property specified in the constructor, the height is set based on the skin height, if the page is resized and the parent div width is smaller then the <span class="boldLi">maxWidth</span> property the Easy Video Player will adapt its size accordingly.</li>
			<pre class="brush: js; html-script: true, class-name: 'negativeLeftMarginsHTML'">
				<div id="myDiv" style="margin:auto;"></div></script></pre>
			<li>Next step is to initialize the Easy Video Player with javascript, in the head section of your html page add the code from the below image. Please note that all parameters are described in the <a href="#config">constructor parameters</a> section.</li>
			<pre class="brush: js; class-name: 'negativeLeftMargins'">

		<h4><strong>Atter parent installation</strong></h3>
		<p>This display type is resizing EVP width and height to fill the available parent div width and height, this is really useful if you have a responsive div and you want EVP to resize based on it's size. To use this display type follow the same installation steps from <a href="#instalation">Responsive installation</a> section, the only difference is the <span class="boldLi">displayType</span> property which must be set to <span class="boldLi">afterParent</span> like this <span class="boldLi">displayType:afterParent</span>.

		<p>There is an example includded in the download files called ANNOTATIONS-example.html, you can use it as reference. First of all to add annotations to a video an ul element with the structure presented below has to be added in the page. Inside it there are the annotations, you can add as many as you like by stacking them one after eachother. The li element that holds the annotation data has some attributes that consturct their logic:<br><br><span class="boldLi">data-start-time</span> - the start time when the annotaton show in hours:minutes:seconds format.<br><span class="boldLi">data-end-time</span> - the end time when the annotaton hide in hours:minutes:seconds format.<br><span class="boldLi">data-left</span> - the left postion in px.<br><span class="boldLi">data-top</span> - the top position in px.<br><span class="boldLi">data-normal-state-class</span> - a css class that represents the annotation normal state.<br><span class="boldLi">data-selected-state-class</span> - a css class that represents the annotation selected state, when the annotation is hovered this class will be applied, please note that this is optional if you don't want a selected state don't add this attribute<br><span class="boldLi">data-show-close-button</span> - this can be yes or no, shows or hides the annotation close button.<br><span class="boldLi">data-click-source</span> - this can contain a page URL or a javascript name ex:<span class="boldLi">data-click-source="myJavascritpFunction();"</span>, this attribute is optional if you don't want to open a page or to call a javascript function on click don't add this attribute.</span><br><span class="boldLi">data-click-source-target</span> - if you want to open a page this is this attribute holds the page target (_blank, _self).</p>
		<p>After the annotation element is created the id of it has to be passed in the contructor  <span class="boldLi">annotiationsListId</span> property like this <span class="boldLi">annotiationsListId:annottaionId</span> in this case <span class="boldLi">annotiationsListId:fwdAnnotations</span>.</p>

		<p>To find the correct postion for the annotation in the contructor set <span class="boldLi">showAnnotationsPositionTool:"yes"</span>, this will allow to drag the annotation in the position that you like and the top and left postion will be displayed this way you will know the exact postion for the annotation. Please don't forget to click the play button and scrub to see your annotation/annotations, when you see the annotation for which you want to find the postion pause the video and drag the annoation at the postion that you like, then  just set <span class="boldLi">data-left</span> and <span class="boldLi">data-top</span> to the desired position. After this process is finished set <span class="boldLi">showAnnotationsPositionTool:"no"</span>.</p>
